## The Abstraction: the process
- the definition of a process, informally, is quite simple: it is a running program
- the os create illusion by virtualizing the CPU. by make all process has same data structure that used to run one process then stop it and running another, and so on and so forth (time sharing).
- scheduling policy: sp is algorithms for making some kind of decision within the os. ex: if we have a bunch of process are waiting to run what is the one is choose.
